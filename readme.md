*** TODO ***
- Ongoing refactoring the mess
- To class or not to class? Get advice so you can ignore it
- Should the entity map use arrays and not objects at tile level?
- Stop redrawing when objects are not in motion or the camera is not being panned
- Undo button
- Make image asset loading async
- Create entity interface
- Actually design a game
- Learn markdown

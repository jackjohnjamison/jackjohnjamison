*** TODO ***
- Maintain origional search path while moving
- Ongoing refactoring the mess
- To class or not to class? Get advice so you can ignore it
- Should the entity map use arrays and not objects at tile level?
- Stop redrawing when objects are not in motion or the camera is not being panned. 
- Undo button
- Create entity interface.
- Actually design a game
- Maybe go back to a large scrolling canvas for performance reasons? Would that cause UI issues again?
